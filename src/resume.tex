    \begin{rSection}{Significant Projects}
        \textbf{Bash Inspired Custom Shell} \\
        A computer shell that can functionally do the basics of what the GNU Bash shell can do like execute commands, piping IO, and running processes in the background. Solution written in \textbf{C}.

        \textbf{CPU and Memory Scheduling Simulator} \\
        Discrete event scheduler to manage threads and processes using various scheduling algorithms. The Memory scheduler kicks processes in and out of memory in the method of choice between scheduling algorithms. Both schedulers were written in \textbf{C} and \textbf{C}.

        \textbf{VHDL CPU Simulator} \\
        A basic virtual CPU that uses registers, latches, and multiplexers to execute \textbf{Mars MIPS} assembly commands that store data in memory and registers. Written in \textbf{VHDL}.

        \textbf{Cellular Automata} \\ 
        A recreation of Conway's game of life. Later, I used this method to create an algorithm to generate randomized terrain generation. Written in \textbf{C}.

        \textbf{Fluid Physics Simulator} \\ 
        A simulation of liquids moving on different surfaces in a 2D space. Written in \textbf{C\#} using the \textbf{Unity} game engine.

        \textbf{Basketball Robot} \\ 
        A school project at the University of Guelph called a Teddy Bear Wheelchair. The wheelchair robot needs to carry around a teddy bear and have it shoot ping pong balls at a basketball net with precise accuracy and have it run a course designed to test its mobility. Written in \textbf{C++} powered by \textbf{Arduino}.
